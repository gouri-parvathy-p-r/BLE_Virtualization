# BLE_Virtualization

# 🧠 BLE Virtualization Framework

This project provides a framework to **virtualize BLE peripheral devices** for large-scale **IoT testing, simulation, and automation**. It allows simulating the behavior of real BLE devices such as smart bulbs, enabling mobile app and cloud interactions without needing the physical hardware.
