Test Category,Test ID,Test Case,Expected Result
Connection & Advertising,A1,App scans for device when bulb is advertising,Device appears in scan results
Connection & Advertising,A2,Device does not advertise,App cannot find device
Connection & Advertising,A3,Advertises with incorrect MAC/name,App may ignore the device or misidentify it
Connection & Advertising,A4,App connects during extended scan window,Connection succeeds
Connection & Advertising,A5,App connects after timeout (e.g., 10s after first scan),Fails or re-triggers scan
Connection & Advertising,A6,Attempt simultaneous connections,Only one central connects; second is rejected
Connection & Advertising,A7,App tries to connect when device is already connected,Error or retry

Pairing & Security,B1,Device requests pairing (Just Works),App initiates pairing without user input
Pairing & Security,B2,App initiates pairing (respond to Security Request),Device responds and bonding succeeds
Pairing & Security,B3,Device has IRK, app uses RPA,Address is resolved and bonded session resumes
Pairing & Security,B4,Human enters wrong PIN/Passkey (if supported),Pairing fails
Pairing & Security,B5,Bonded device reconnects after reboot,Bonded session resumes without pairing
Pairing & Security,B6,Try to pair when already encrypted,Pairing ignored or rejected
Pairing & Security,B7,Unbonding from app then reconnect,Triggers re-pairing or fails connection

GATT Operations,C1,App sends ON command to Smart Bulb,Bulb state changes to ON
GATT Operations,C2,App sends OFF command to Smart Plug,Plug switches OFF
GATT Operations,C3,App requests bulb color/state,Correct GATT read response sent
GATT Operations,C4,App writes invalid value (e.g., 0xFF for bool),Write rejected or ignored
GATT Operations,C5,App subscribes to notifications,Device sends state updates on change
GATT Operations,C6,App unsubscribes,No further notifications sent
GATT Operations,C7,Multiple GATT commands in quick succession,All handled without crash/drop
GATT Operations,C8,Write to non-writable characteristic,Write fails with error
GATT Operations,C9,Read from a secure characteristic before pairing,Read fails
GATT Operations,C10,Read from secure characteristic after bonding,Succeeds

Human Errors,D1,User tries to pair with a powered-off device,No response or scan fails
Human Errors,D2,User moves device out of range after pairing,Disconnection event handled
Human Errors,D3,User rapidly toggles power in app,State changes processed or throttled
Human Errors,D4,User forgets device in system Bluetooth and reconnects,App re-pairs successfully
Human Errors,D5,App crashes during active session,Device handles disconnection cleanly
Human Errors,D6,Virtual device crashes mid-session,App retries or throws error
Human Errors,D7,Time mismatch between app and device,Scheduling may fail or misfire

Generic BLE Behavior,E1,Device uses extended advertising,App supports extended format
Generic BLE Behavior,E2,Device uses BLE Privacy (RPA),App resolves address with IRK
Generic BLE Behavior,E3,Device supports multiple roles,Roles handled properly
Generic BLE Behavior,E4,Connection parameter update request,Accepted or renegotiated
Generic BLE Behavior,E5,GATT MTU exchange negotiation,MTU set to max supported
Generic BLE Behavior,E6,App requests notifications without CCCD write,No notifications sent
Generic BLE Behavior,E7,CCCD write but char doesn’t support Notify,Ignored or error
Generic BLE Behavior,E8,BLE peripheral initiates disconnection,App handles and displays it
Generic BLE Behavior,E9,Attempt reconnection within 1s,Device may reject or accept
Generic BLE Behavior,E10,Send large attribute value (>20 bytes),Correctly fragmented via ATT
Generic BLE Behavior,E11,Simulate packet loss or RF drop,App retries or fails gracefully

BLE Profile Edge Cases,F1,HR monitor: App polls continuously,Notifications sent periodically
BLE Profile Edge Cases,F2,Temperature sensor: °F sent instead of °C,App misreads or mislabels
BLE Profile Edge Cases,F3,BLE Lock: unlock without bonding,Rejected if bonding required
BLE Profile Edge Cases,F4,HID sends report before encryption,Blocked if not allowed
BLE Profile Edge Cases,F5,Beacon rapidly changes UUID,App handles zone switch correctly

Protocol Compliance,G1,Invalid ATT opcode sent by app,Error Response sent
Protocol Compliance,G2,App sends Read Blob without offset,Error if not supported
Protocol Compliance,G3,App sends signed write,Must verify signature or fail
Protocol Compliance,G4,Unexpected packet sequence,Device handles or rejects
Protocol Compliance,G5,GATT service UUID misaligned,Ignored or rejected
